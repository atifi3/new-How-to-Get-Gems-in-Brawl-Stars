Grind Through Power League
If you are a skillful player, do not miss your chance and grind through Power League. This game mode is the answer to how to get free gems Brawl Stars and other valuable rewards. The only problem here is that you need to reach 4,500 Trophies before you can participate in it.

If you have never played it before, treat it as a typical ranked mode in any other game. To describe it briefly, each match represents a 3v3 encounter. During it, you will compete against the toughest players, depending on what rank you have.

To ensure you hit a higher place in the leaderboard and score the best rewards, you can count on SkyCoach again. By purchasing our Power League Rank Boost, we can help you climb all the way up to the Master rank. Thanks to our service, you will get the most exceptional rewards by the end of each season. So, if you do not want to grind through the ranked yourself, trust this job to us.

NOTE: Hitting the highest rank in Power League still does not guarantee that you will receive gems. The reason for this is that the pool of rewards is always randomized. Try to reach the rank you can and hope luck is on your side.



Complete Brawl Pass
If you decide to complete Brawl Pass, you have two options here. You can either progress through its free version only or get the paid alternative instead. Both of them are your key to how to get more gems in Brawl Stars without doing much. However, you will have to invest your real money if you wish to claim more gems in the long run.

We also recommend that you stick to the paid version if you have some extra funds. Thanks to it, you can also earn the following rewards:

Credits
Coins
Power Points
If you spend enough time playing the game, completing the entire Brawl Pass will not be a problem. In case you don‚Äôt, go ahead and use our Brawl Pass Boost to get to level 30 in a blink of an eye.

Play Club Wars
Moving to other tips on how to earn gems in Brawl Stars 2024, you definitely want to play Club Wars. The idea is quite similar to Power League we have talked about already. The only difference is that you play in a team/guild this time. This means you need to make sure you have found reliable friends to cooperate with.

Similarly to the ranked mode, the quality of the rewards received depends on how well you perform. If you have no friends to create your club, you can join the existing one. However, you will have to prove that you are a worthy member. The chances you stay in a club that always hits first place without showing consistent results on your own are not that high.

Do Daily Quests & Events
A few years back, doing quests and events in the game was really rewarding. You could easily score 3-4 gems at once. But then, the developers realized that was a bit too generous since people were not putting in much effort. So, they toned it down a lot, and now it's pretty rare to find quests like that.

For a better understanding of what these daily quests can be, take a look at this table:

Quest	Description
Win 3 Games with Shelly	You need to play and win three matches as Shelly. If you do not know much about this brawler, she uses a shotgun to deal devastating damage at closer range. Shelly is easy to get the hang of, and winning this number of games should not be a problem.
Deal 60,000 Damage in Gem Grab	This is a 3v3 mode where teams collect and hold onto gems. The only goal you need to achieve here is to deal enough damage when playing this mode. Winning a match is not required.
Complete 2 Games in Heist	Here, you simply need to participate in and finish two matches in the Heist mode. It does not matter if you win or lose, the quest still counts as finished.
Even now, you might stumble upon a quest or event that gives out a few free gems for participating. However, it is totally random, and you cannot predict when it will happen. These quests are usually pretty easy and quick to complete. It all comes down to luck if you happen to get one of these gem-giving quests.

Open Brawl Boxes
While this is a paid method, we cannot forget to mention Brawl Boxes. Their main feature is that they are rarely found in the store. The chances were much higher several years ago, but this is what we have today. The way Brawl Boxes work is quite straightforward. You pay gems to get more gems ‚Äì simple as that. Apart from the paid currency, you can get unique cosmetic items. Despite being a paid way of earning gems, at least your chances of becoming richer are noticeably higher.

Look for Cheaper Gem Packs
When it comes to Gem Packs, they function in quite a similar manner to Brawl Boxes we have just talked about. The only difference is that they are available all the time. However, you do not want to rush and buy them straight away.

Your goal is to wait for a large event to occur and purchase them at their lowest price. These so-called ‚Äúdiscount windows‚Äù do not last too long, and you should prepare enough cash to get the desired amount of the currency. While this is another paid method of acquiring Brawl Stars gems, at least you pay a lower price, right?

Conclusion
To sum up our guide on how to get Brawl Stars gems, we have covered all the available methods existing today. As time passes, the devs do everything possible to make players buy this currency directly from the in-game shop. They leave fewer ways to acquire gems without spending real money.

Luckily for you, our article was the only thing you needed in this case. Within these pages, we have discovered both free and paid methods to get this coveted currency.
